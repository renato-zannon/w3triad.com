A simple prototype for our (hopefully not much) future website.

This repo is going to be a place where experiments are made and ideas are tested. It's probably going to change a lot, and anything you find here will be fairly experimental.
Also, before you say it, _I KNOW_ about gems like Radiant CMS and rails_admin, but the whole point of this project is to build the website/blog "from scratch" using "only" rails3. Why would someone want to reinvent the wheel you ask... Well, just because I can :)
